    "Profitable automated trading strategy plays a critical role to investment companies and hedge funds. Given that the stock market is dynamic and complex, it is challenging to design such a strategy. The project proposes to use a deep reinforcement learning framework to learn a profitable stock trading mechanism, with the goal to optimize the cumulative return and Alpha.\n",

Each dataset row is comprised of date, open price, high price, low price, close price, volumn, ticker symbol, # day in a week and technical indicators. The technical indicators are computed using the original data, which include moving average convergence divergence, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index, Commodity Channel Index , Directional Movement Index and Simple Moving Average.  The dataset has 105680 rows in total. We split the dataset into training and test on a 90/10 basis. The training set contains data ranging from 2000 to 2018, while the test set contains data ranging from 2019 to 2020."
